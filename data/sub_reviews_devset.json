It will work for larger brush and small trees with multiple swings but I find it easier to use a bow saw for the occasional larger plants I encounter. Note that if you need to cut a lot of larger brush a brush hook would be better than this ditch bank blade as the brush hook blade is thicker and heavier.The tool needs to be sharpened right out of the package to perform best. This removes the paint and any nicks and burrs from the factory grinding as well shipping and handling nicks. I resharpen the blades and spray them with WD-40 after each use so it remains rust free and is ready to go for the next session of cutting brush. Also, I suggest installing either lock washers or nyloc nuts on the bolts to keep them tight in use. Even with that, check them after each use to make sure they are tight--it seems that initially the ash handle compresses a bit and the metal side plates need time to seat fully into the ash.This tool has been a huge improvement over my large lopping shears and machette for clearing brush on a new rail trail.Great tool if used appropriately.

The corkscrew design twists into the end of the corn. I thought this was a genius idea but the problem is that the prong continues to twist when in the corn. Since it doesn't have a second prong to prevent the pivoting, the corn will flip and slip all around the prong, which is super annoying when trying to butter and eat.

No more expenses toward bug sprays and rash ointments. As far as cleaning and maintaining the bug lamp, I have had no need to do this as I have set up a litter tray lined with a mixture of fine sand and baking soda, which I periodically empty and refill.

Things quickly spiral out of control when it appears that someone has sabotaged one of the leading robots and the reality show host is killed in the first moments of the show.Fifteen-year-old inventor Toby Baudernach has more at stake than anybody else on the island-- he hopes to use the prize money to help save the life of his terminally ill brother-- but when his creation,Eve, kills the show's host in the first moments of the game, he and his best friend, Caitlin Steel, are suddenly fighting for their lives to survive.I was worried that this book would be derivative, a Hunger Games knock-off, but it was full of twists and surprises all the way through. The action never stops, nor does the suspense, and there are a dizzying array of alliances, good guys and bad guys so it is hard to tell just exactly who can be trusted. I am sure that young adults who are into gaming will enjoy the book.My only complaint is that I would have liked a character list-- there were so many people I kept getting confused about who was who.

As I would expect, I couldn't put down Jonathan Kellerman's murder mystery, who-done-it-psychological-thriller, until I'd finished it.  What I didn't expect is that I'd have the same experience with Daniel Berenson's book, Firebug, a book about two young middle-schoolers, Bobby and Curtis, who get caught up in fire obsession so that Curtis is burned horribly, gruesomely disfigured, and Bobby who planned to burn down his middle school, ends up saving Curtis's life, his own life, and both their self-esteems. Both kids, through being paired up after their horrific experiences, grow beyond their obsession, their naivety, and their fears, and develop mature character through their growing friendship.  Firebug gives its readers hope for all messed up kids from all types of families and walks of life.  Daniel Berenson writes the book so realistically that you can believe in the young characters' psychological and emotional transformation.  You believe it's real for the kids and as an added bonus (that comes across as real also), you see that Bobby's dad, who never liked his son, is transformed himself, as he has the insight that his son is full of heart, courage, and compassion, something he realized was lacking in himself as he watched his son's friendship develop with Curtis. If you like to read tales with psychological twists like Kellerman's tales, then you will like Firebug and appreciate it for its psychological portrayals, insights, and hope it provides in the face of gruesome challenges, that sooner or later, all of us will experience on some level by continuing to remain alive.
